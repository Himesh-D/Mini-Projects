# ☕ Java Mini Projects

A collection of **beginner-friendly Java mini projects** designed to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and build small but functional console based applications.  

This repository will gradually include multiple projects, each focusing on different Java concepts such as classes, inheritance, exception handling, and file handling.
